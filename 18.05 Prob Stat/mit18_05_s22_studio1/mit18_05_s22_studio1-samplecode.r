# Section 1. print and cat statements
# to display answers
x = 5
y = 10
print(x) # Shows the value of x
cat(x, "\n") # Shows the value of x
# cat doesn't automatically start a
# new line. The "\n" makes it start
# a new line.
# The following shows values of x and y
cat("x =", x, "y =", y, "\n")

# Section 2: choose, factorial, sample functions

# To find n choose k use choose(n, k)
x = choose(4, 2)
print(x)
x = choose(10, 3)
print(x)
x = choose(100, 42)
print(x)

# Compute the number of ways to get 1 pair and the
# probability of one pair
x = choose(13, 1)*choose(4, 2)*choose(12, 3)*4*4*4
print(x)
y = choose(13, 1)*choose(4, 2)*choose(12, 3)*4*4*4/choose(52, 5)
print(y)

# factorial does what it says
x = factorial(3)
print(x)
x = factorial(4)
print(x)
x = factorial(22)
print(x)

#sample picks random values from a list
x = sample(1:5, 3)  #pick 3 elements from 1,2,3,4,5 --no repeats allowed
print(x)

x = sample(1:5, 5)  #Permutes the 5 elements
print(x)

# Uncomment out the next line and run it to see it fail. Then comment it back out so it doesn't cause problems.
#sample(1:5, 7)  #Fails because repeats are not allowed

# Section 3: making arrays
#very often we want to arrange our data in rows and columns
#The matrix command does this for us.
x = matrix(1:30, nrow=5) #If you only set nrow, matrix will figure out ncol
print(x)
# N.B. matrix breaks the list into columns --this is opposite what you might expect. As is typical in R there is a parameter in the matrix() function to change this. See if you can figure it out.

# Section 4: colSums function
x=sample(0:1, 30, replace=TRUE)
print(x)
y=matrix(x, nrow=5, ncol=6)
print(y)
#colSums() sums each of the columns of y.

# First we'll do 1 trial of nrolls 
# of an nsides-sided die
# Give values understandable names.
# In this code an initial 'n' means 'number of'

# colMatches is a function we wrote for 18.05. In this case it checks the vector trials to see if size_match of the entries are the same.
# Look for two rolls the same

# Now we'll run ntrials at once

# Divide by ntrials to get the fraction of trials with a match
print(sum(w)/ntrials)
# A simpler way to get the fraction in one command is with mean()

# Section 6: SIMPLE PLOTTING
# 1. seq(start, stop, increment) makes a list of numbers from start to stop in steps of increment
# 2. sin(x) applies sin to every element in x
# 3. plot has lots of ways to control the plot type='l' says to connect the points in (x,y) by lines, lwd is the line width
x = seq(0, 6*pi, 0.01)

#-------------------------
# Section 7: MAKING GRAPHS OF THE RESULTS
# Here's code to plot the (estimated) probability of a match vs nrolls in a trial
# It uses a 'for loop' to run the simulation for various values of nrolls

# If you don't know about 'for loops' don't worry about it. We'll learn more about them soon.
